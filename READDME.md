# Delivery Time Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

The **Delivery Time Prediction** project aims to estimate the exact delivery time for orders based on various features. By leveraging linear regression, we model the relationship between delivery time and relevant factors such as weather conditions, delivery vehicle type, delivery person's age, and their rating.

## Project Flow

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather relevant data, including delivery records, weather data, vehicle details, and delivery person information.
   - Ensure data quality and consistency.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Perform feature engineering (e.g., creating new features, transforming existing ones).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
   - Identify potential relationships between features and delivery time.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Choose relevant features for the linear regression model.
   - Consider factors like multicollinearity and feature importance.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model using the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the trained model (e.g., as a REST API or web service).
   - Integrate it into your delivery management system.

## Methods of Development

1. **Python Environment Setup:**
   - Create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`.
   - Install necessary packages (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Write scripts to collect data from various sources (APIs, databases, CSV files).
   - Clean and preprocess the data using pandas.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Use Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore data visually.
   - Generate plots, histograms, and scatter plots.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features (e.g., combining weather conditions, calculating delivery person experience).
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Implement linear regression using scikit-learn.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Choose a deployment method (e.g., Flask API, FastAPI, cloud services).
   - Document how to use the deployed model.

## Short Description

The **Delivery Time Prediction** project leverages linear regression to estimate delivery times based on weather conditions, vehicle type, delivery person age, and rating. By deploying this model, we enhance delivery efficiency and provide accurate time estimates to customers.
