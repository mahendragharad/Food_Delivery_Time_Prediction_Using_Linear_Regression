# Roadmap for Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict Delivery Time

## 1. Understanding the Data and Problem Statement
``Your dataset contains information about restaurants, their location, cuisine types, cost, and ratings, among other features. The goal is to predict delivery time, although this feature is not listed, we assume you will have a target variable for delivery time in your dataset.``

## 2. Feature Selection
``Identify relevant features that can impact delivery time:``

``Restaurant Location: Country Code, City, Address, Locality, Longitude, Latitude
Cuisines: Cuisines``
``Cost and Price Range: Average Cost for two, Currency, Price range
Service Availability: Has Table booking, Has Online delivery, Is delivering now, Switch to order menu
Popularity and Rating: Aggregate rating, Rating color, Rating text, Votes``
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
``Step 1: Data Cleaning``
``Check for null values and handle them``.
``Handle duplicate entries.``
``Step 2: Data Visualization``
``Visualize the distribution of each feature.``
``Use histograms for numerical features.``
``Use bar plots for categorical features.``
``Step 3: Correlation Analysis``
``Use heatmaps to check correlation between numerical features.``
``Step 4: Feature Engineering``
``Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.``
## 4. Handling Missing Values
``Identify Missing Values``
``Use df.isnull().sum() to identify missing values.``
``Handle Missing Values``
``For numerical features: Use mean, median, or mode.``
``For categorical features: Use mode or a new category like 'Unknown'.
``Use SimpleImputer from scikit-learn for systematic imputation.``
## 5. Handling Outliers
``Identify Outliers``
Use box plots or the Z-score method to identify outliers.``
``Remove Outliers``
``Z-score method: Remove data points where Z-score > 3.``
``IQR method: Remove data points outside the range``

## 6. Feature Engineering
``Create new features if necessary (e.g., distance based on latitude and longitude).``
``Normalize or scale numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.``
## 7. Model Selection
``Algorithms to Consider``
``Linear Regression``
``Decision Trees``
``Random Forest``
``Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)``
``Support Vector Machine (SVM)``
``Neural Networks (if the dataset is large and complex)``
``Recommendation``
``Start with simpler models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees).``
``Use ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for better accuracy.``
## 8. Model Evaluation
``Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.``
``Metrics to consider:``
``Mean Absolute Error (MAE)``
``Mean Squared Error (MSE)``
``R-squared (R²)``
``Fine-tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.``
